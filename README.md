## Book Cipher in Python
# This repository contains a Python implementation of the Book Cipher technique. 
The Book Cipher is a cryptographic algorithm that uses a book or text as the key to encrypt and decrypt messages. For Now, 
the algo for encrypting and decrypting messages is pretty simple. 
* Encrypting Plain Text Messages into 3 number Code Per Word. 
* Decrypting 3 number codes (Per Word) into Plain Text Messages.
* 3 number Code --> [ PageNum , LineNum , WordNum ] (For Now).
* Very Simple yet Dynamic GUI using Tkinter Lib for Sophistication.
* Making Sure that without the Right key/pdf, it's impossible to crack the description ðŸ’ª
